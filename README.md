# hashmap_cpp
A hashmap implementation I wrote for some coursework. Some things are missing/incomplete, but adding and referencing hashmap entries is functional.

## TODO:

- create hashmap::rehash()

## Notes

`solution_custom.cpp`, `solution_std.cpp`, `tests/` and the usage of them in the `Makefile` are remnants from the coursework. They are meant for local testing now.
