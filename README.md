# hashmap_cpp
A hashmap implementation I wrote for some coursework.

## TODO:

- make implementation type-universal -- can only use with string keys currently

## How to Implement

If for whatever reason you'd like to implement my amateur code in your project, use the following line in your C++ files as necessary.

```c++
#include "hashmap.hpp"
```

Just make sure to update the path to `hashmap.hpp` if it is not in the same directory as the linked file.


## Notes

`solution_custom.cpp`, `solution_std.cpp`, `tests/` and the usage of them in the `Makefile` are remnants from the coursework. They are meant for local testing now.
